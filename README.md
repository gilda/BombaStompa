# BombaStompa

BombaStompa is a time-stamping service built on Ethereum. This service allows you to prove that some file or any data existed before some time point (time-stamping). The time-stamping is only accurate to ~ Â± 20 sec as the timing data is dependent on the ethereum network.

### Notes
This is a monorepo which includes both Ethereum contracts as well as a web interface for BombaStompa.
**I'm not a cryptographer nor a security engineer, this service might not be secure!**

### Usage
To use this service you must be using MetaMask. Each hash entry is linked to a name you give it while submitting it and to the Ethereum account you used to submit it; thus meaning that in order to retrieve a given hash entry you **must** use the same name and Ethereum account used to submit it.
